    <p><i><h2>Interesting facts about Teddy-bear</h2></i></p>

    <ul>
        <li>The teddy was named after President Theodore Roosevelt, after he refused to shoot a bear during a 1902 hunting trip.</li>
        <li>Inspired by a cartoon featuring the event, shopkeeper Morris Michtom and his wife Rose made a stuffed bear with a sign ‘Teddy’s bear’ and left it in their shop window. It gained so much attention that they started a successful toy making company.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in Germany in the same year, the Steiff family developed a silk-like fabric bear, based on zoo animals. They caused a sensation at a toy fair and were snapped up by an American buyer.</li>
        <li> They aren’t just for children – 40% of teddy sales are for adults, and a quarter of us still has our childhood companion.</li>
        <li>A teddy has been into space! Magellan T Bear boarded Space Shuttle Discovery in 1995 as part of a school project.</li>

    <p><i><h2>Interesting facts about Cicada</h2></i></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. They are about the size of a grain of rice when they drop from a tree branch to the ground and start digging</li>
        <li>The loud whirring or buzzing sound you hear is an all-male cicada chorus. (Females make a much quieter sound by flicking their wings.) Cicadas don’t sing at night, so don’t blame them if you can’t sleep</li>
        <li>Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes. Keep on the lookout</li>
        <li>Females may be attracted to the sound of motors. So you get to watch your dad, mom or older sibling get swarmed while they’re using the lawn mower or power tools</li>
